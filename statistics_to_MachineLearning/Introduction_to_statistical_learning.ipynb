    "\n",
    "Statistical inference is the process of using data analysis to deduce properties of an underlying probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning algorithms are algorithms for building inference algorithms from examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modelling: consist of describing dataset in quantitative, mathematical manner. There are 02 types of models: \n",
    "-probabilistic models:used to find a probability distribution that describes the dataset\n",
    "-geometric models: used to find some kind of geometric structure that describes  dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine learning examples \n",
    "• **Classification:** from data to discrete classes\n",
    "- Spam filtering\n",
    "- Object detection (e.g., face)\n",
    "- Weather prediction (e.g., rain, snow, sun)\n",
